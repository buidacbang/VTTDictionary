    "description": "An asset is a resource with economic value that a company owns or controls with the expectation that it will provide future benefit. Assets are reported on a company's balance sheet, and they are bought or created to increase the value of a firm or benefit the firm's operations. An asset can be thought of as something that in the future can generate cash flow, reduce expenses, improve sales, regardless of whether it's a company's manufacturing equipment or a patent on a particular technology. Assets can be divided into two categories: current and noncurrent. Current assets are items listed on a company's balance sheet that are expected to be converted into cash within one fiscal year. Current assets include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, prepaid expenses. and other liquid assets that can be readily converted to cash.Non-current assets, noncurrent assets are long-term assets that a company expects to hold over one fiscal year that cannot readily be converted to cash within a year. Some examples of noncurrent assets are fixed assets, intangible assets and long-term investments. Fixed assets include property, plans and equipment that a company owns that are not expected to be converted into cash within one fiscal year.",
